# This project is no longer maintained
**Unfortunately Adobe and D3 have changed a lot since this paper was published, and I quickly ran out of time / funding to maintain the extension. Also, I think my old university has recently deleted the space where I was hosting the extension bundles.**

**This code is still up here in case anyone wants to build something similiar. Please feel free to fork / copy / paste (see LICENSE.md)!**

# hanpuku #

Hanpuku is an interface between d3.js and Adobe Illustrator, enabling a more flexible
data visualization workflow. Data bindings no longer disappear when you edit a d3-generated
graphic in Illustrator; those bindings now survive custom edits, and even
get saved inside native .ai files.

On the flip side, your custom Illustrator edits
will also survive properly-written d3.js scripts: now, when your data changes after
you've done lots of hand-crafted awesomeness, you don't have to start over from scratch!

Another cool addition is that Illustrator and d3.js selections are merged; you can now
set attributes for stuff you have selected in Illustrator like a normal d3.js selection. You can
even filter the current Illustrator selection based on data, or perform complex selections right from
the code!

Installation
------------

### Easiest approach: Installing with ZXPInstaller
Install [ZXPInstaller](http://zxpinstaller.com/), and use it to install the bundled [hanpuku extension](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~abigelow/Downloads/hanpuku/hanpuku.0.1.10.zxp).

### Official approach: Installing via the Adobe Add-ons Page
In theory\*, you should be able to just install Hanpuku is via the [Adobe Add-ons](https://creative.adobe.com/addons/products/15087) page with one click.

\* Adobe's add-on system is *very* broken. In practice, I've found that you have to mess with your Creative Cloud settings, and possibly completely uninstall / reinstall Illustrator itself to get it to work. Even when it does work, it can take a few minutes for extensions to show up in the Creative Cloud "Activity Stream" (the Home tab of the desktop app) after clicking "Install"... and only then can you quit / reopen Illustrator to see it in action. If you run into any of these issues, installing from source may be easier.

### Hard Core approach: Installing via the source code
This way is a little trickier, but many users (myself included) have had problems with Adobe Add-ons; if neither of the above two approaches work, this is your best shot. Or if you want to help with development, this is how you'll want to get set up.

#### Step 1
With Illustrator closed, open the terminal and type or paste these commands:

```
cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Adobe/
mkdir CEP
mkdir CEP/extensions
cd CEP/extensions
git clone https://github.com/alex-r-bigelow/hanpuku.git
```

If you don't have git installed on your system, you can download the [zipped source code](https://github.com/alex-r-bigelow/hanpuku/archive/master.zip), extract it, and type this instead of the last line:
```
mv ~/Downloads/hanpuku-master ~/Library/Application\ Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/hanpuku
```

#### Step 2
Illustrator won't normally load the extension unless it's cryptographically signed. The ZXP / Add-on installation routes should handle this for you, but if you're installing from the source code, you'll have to disable this check.

Open `~/Library/Preferences/com.adobe.CSXS.7.plist` with a plain text editor (TextEdit *won't* do this correctly; use something like TextWrangler). To find the file in the Finder, you might need to hit `Command+Shift+G`, and paste that path.

Add `<key>PlayerDebugMode</key>` and `<string>1</string>` so the file looks like this:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>LogLevel</key>
	<string>1</string>
	<key>PlayerDebugMode</key>
	<string>1</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

#### Step 3
You should now be able to launch Illustrator and open the Hanpuku extension window.

### Troubleshooting
If encounter problems, please file an issue! If possible, include the following information:
- Let me know what approaches you tried to install hanpuku, and what happened
- Include the version of Illustrator that you're running on ("Illustrator CC" -> "About Illustrator...")
- If you get far enough to see the hanpuku window (even if it's blank) try navigating to [http://localhost:8088](http://localhost:8088). There you *should* see an "index.html" linkâ€”if you click it, it will bring up Chrome's developer tools in the regular browser window. Please report any errors you see on the Console.

Work in progress:
-----------------
#### Crazy ideas to explore
- Sync with Chrome dev tools (create a Hanpuku Chrome extension for smooth two-way transitions?)
- Add better, cleaner import / export / copy / paste features for full HTML or SVG snippets
  - Provide more user control about what gets imported / exported / copied / pasted:
    - Options to handle CSS rules that apply to snippets (but the rules themselves may live off in a stylesheet somewhere)?
    - Options to control whether / how D3 bindings, event bindings, and other javascript properties that aren't in the HTML can be preserved
      - (does any of this change with Illustrator's new-ish, yet still freakishly limiting variable / "graph" data binding approaches? Is there a better way to integrate?)
    - Other options besides my mandatory SVG element = Illustrator artboard interpretation
    - Controls to preserve rects as rects instead of converting everything to paths all the time?
    - Text conversion issues are extremely messy internally - I should probably expose these issues rather than impose them myself

#### Known bugs
- Text rotation / scale bugs
- Links to Swatch colors are lost (need to do a true diff model...?)
- Arc approximation irregularities
- Duplicate path endpoints
- Need to turn off perspective grid or isolation mode temporarily (if they're on) in domToDoc, or stuff dies (how to do this with jsx?)

#### High priority
- Replace textareas with ace editors, better file saving / organization / syncing
- Better font support
- Bitmap support
- Gradient support
- Mask support
- Symbol support
- Stroke properties (dashes, caps, etc.)

#### Medium priority
- Regex search/replace in text editors (esp. data)
- Circular data in the Data preview (visualize cycles)
- More examples
- Proper CMYK color
- Export as/to web page
- Add some kind of placeholder in each environment for unsupported items like blends/graphs, or videos/form elements?

#### Low priority
- Implement non-programmer UX
- Embed the Chrome debugging window as a view
- Embed data, js, css files inside the .ai file (preserve layer-level properties while I'm at it)
- Load multiple js, css files, distinguish between js libraries and scripts (run the former immediately)

#### Very low priority
- Investigate what it would take to make an Inkscape clone / make Hanpuku an independent application
- Test on Windows
- Tangelo integration / streaming data support
